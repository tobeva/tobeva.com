* Finishing up work on  [Napari Image Viewer](https://napari.org/) for [The
  Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/). See [our
  project page](/projects/napari) for details.

* Writing some performance monitoring tools that use `chrome://tracing` for
  visualizing the runtime behavior of programs, similar to what we did for
  Napari. Hoping to open source these.

* Learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.

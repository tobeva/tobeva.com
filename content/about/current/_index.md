* Working on the [Napari Image Viewer](https://napari.org/) for [The Chan
  Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/). See a nice demo
  video on [our project page](/projects/napari) for details.

* Writing some performance monitoring tools that use `chrome://tracing` for
  visualizing the runtime behavior of programs, similar to what we did for
  Napari. Hoping to open source these.

* Learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
  
* Setting up this website, the source is [public on
  GitHub](https://github.com/tobeva/tobeva.com).

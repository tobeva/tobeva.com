* Working for [The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) on the [Napari](https://napari.org/) project. See our contributions including a nice demo video on our [Napari project page](/projects/napari).

* Writing some performance monitoring tools that use `chrome://tracing` for
  visualizing the runtime behavior of programs, similar to what we did for
  Napari. Hoping to open source these.

* Learning the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
  
* Setting up this website which is [public on
  GitHub](https://github.com/tobeva/tobeva.com). You can even submit a PR
  to propose a change to the site, such as adding a link to our [resources
  section](/resources).

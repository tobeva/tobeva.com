I'm working on an ongoing paid contract for [The Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) to improve the rendering behavior
and performance of [Napari](https://napari.org/), an open source
multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, used for scientific imaging
mostly in the fields of Neuroscience and Biology.

Read [my blog post](/blog/2020/08/02/open-source/) on how it has been
working on open source as opposed to proprietary commercial software.

Because the project is open source I can share some documents, pull
requests and videos I've done for the project.

**Documents:**
* [Performance Backgrounder and Philosophy](https://napari.org/docs/explanations/performance.html)
* [Render System Design](https://napari.org/docs/explanations/rendering.html)

**Pull Requests:**
* [Performance Monitoring](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/1453)
* [Asynchronous Image Loading](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/1510)

**Videos:**

I started Tobeva Software in April 2020 to do consulting and contracting in
cloud data pipelines, high-performance systems and computer graphics. Read
more about my [industry experience](/about/experience/) or [about
me](/about/philip).

I'm open to contracts implementing new features, tools, or prototypes, as
well as shorter consulting engagements. For example, I can analyze
architecture and code quality, set up build automation, continuous
integration or static analysis. I can improve automated testing, quantify
and fix performance issues, or track down difficult bugs.

I've primarily worked in C/C++, Python and Javascript, but I'm interested
in other languages such as Go and Rust, and could come up to speed quickly.
I work remotely from my home in Winchester, Virginia.

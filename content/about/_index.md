### Overview

I started **Tobeva Software** in April 2020 to do consulting and contracting in
cloud data pipelines, high-performance systems and computer graphics.

After a few successful contracts, however, I returned to full-time regular
employment when I joined [BenchSci](http://benchsci.com) in May 2022. So I'm not
currently seeking new contracts.

I will keep this site running indefinately and might return to contracting some
day. Feel free to contact me, **philip<img src="" width="0"

### Overview

I started **Tobeva Software** in April 2020 to do consulting and contracting in
cloud data pipelines, high-performance systems and computer graphics. I'm open
to new contracts starting March 2023.

### Background

Over the past 25 years I've worked in many different technical industries such
as [CAD and Haptics](/about/experience/cad), [Autonomous
Vehicles](/about/experience/cloud), [Cloud Data
Pipelines](/about/experience/cloud/), [Neuroscience
Research](/about/experience/neuroscience/), [Military
Simulations](/about/experience/simulations/) and
[Videogames](/about/experience/videogames/). Many of the systems I have worked
on have involved graphics, but not all of them.

I have found over the years that working in graphics, games and simulations
is a fantastic way to build general software engineering skills.

When working, I try to blend hard-core engineering with pragmatism. In my
opinion the goal of a software developer is to solve problems and create
value. This can involve writing code, but often selecting where to dig is
more important than the digging itself. One of the biggest sources of
preventable waste in our industry is the time and money spent writing
software that simply should never have been written.

My primary languages are Python and Javascript, but I have many years of
experience in C++ and some exposure to C# and Java. I'm interested in learning
Rust. I work remotely from my home in Winchester, Virginia. Please drop me a

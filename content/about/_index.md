I started Tobeva Software to do consulting and contracting in cloud data
pipelines, high-performance systems and computer graphics. Read more about
my [industry experience](/about/experience/) or [about me](/about/philip).

I offer consulting services such as the analysis of architecture and code
quality, build automation and continuous integration, automated testing,
quantifying and fixing performance issues, tracking down difficult bugs. Or
just implementation of new features or tools or prototypes.

I've primarily worked in C/C++, Python and Javascript, but I'm interested
in other languages such as Go and Rust, and could come up to speed quickly.
I work remotely from my home in Winchester, Virginia.

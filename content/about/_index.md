### Overview

I started **Tobeva Software** in April 2020 to do consulting and
contracting in cloud data pipelines, high-performance systems and computer
graphics.

Read more about my [industry experience](/about/experience/) or
[about me](/about/philip).

I'm open to contracts implementing new features, tools, or prototypes, as
well as shorter consulting engagements. For example, I can spend a week or
two analyzing your architecture and code quality, or setting up build
automation, continuous integration or static analysis. I can quantify and
fix performance issues or track down difficult bugs.

I've primarily worked in C/C++, Python and Javascript, but I'm interested
in other languages such as Go and Rust, and could come up to speed quickly.
I have five years of experience with AWS, but would be happy to use other
cloud services also. I work remotely from my home in Winchester, Virginia.

**Consult** &middot; **Design** &middot; **Develop**

Icy morning, Winchester, Virginia. February 2022.

### Overview

**New Blog Post**: [Software Engineering Radio](/blog/2022/02/26/my-experience-as-a-software-engineering-radio-host/)

I started **Tobeva Software** in April 2020 to do consulting and
contracting in cloud data pipelines, high-performance systems and computer
graphics.

Read more about my [industry experience](/about/experience/) or
[about me](/about/philip).

I'm available for short to medium term consulting engagements or contracts.
I'm able to work on new features, tools, or prototypes, or do one-off
projects such as setting up Continuous Integration or other build
automation such as testing, doing static analysis, or fixing performance
issues or difficult bugs. I recently helped migrate a company from Perforce
to Git and I could advise or help with setting up Git-based workflows.

I've primarily worked in C++, C#, Python and Javascript, but I'm interested
in other languages such as Go and Rust, and could come up to speed quickly.
I have five years of experience with AWS, but would be happy to use other
cloud services also. I work remotely from my home in Winchester, Virginia.

**Highlighted**: _Brain Oriented Programming_ [article](/articles/brain-oriented-programming/) or [video](https://youtu.be/D8Pb8TvYsCE).

We are a small consulting and contracting company specializing in cloud
data pipelines, high performance systems and computer graphics. See our
[experience](/about/experience/) section for industries we've worked in.

We offer consulting services such as the analysis of architecture and code
quality, build automation and continuous integration, automated testing,
quantifying and fixing performance issues, tracking down difficult bugs.
The final product can be as simple as a writeup or report, or we can
implement the solution for you.

We primarily work in C/C++, Python and Javascript but are interested in
getting into Go and Rust development and could come up to speed quickly. We
are located in Winchester, Virginia.

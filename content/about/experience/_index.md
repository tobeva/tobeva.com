Over the past 25 years I've worked in many different technical industries such
as [CAD and Haptics](/about/experience/cad), [Autonomous
Vehicles](/about/experience/cloud), [Cloud Data
Pipelines](/about/experience/cloud/), [Neuroscience
Research](/about/experience/neuroscience/), [Military
Simulations](/about/experience/simulations/) and
[Videogames](/about/experience/videogames/). Many of the systems I have worked
on have involved graphics, but not all of them.

My primary languages are Python, C++, and Javascript, but I have recent
experience with C#, Java and Go. I would be interested in learning Rust.

I joined [Harmonix](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/) in 2003 to work on [EyeToy:
Antigrav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy:_AntiGrav) for the PlayStation 2.
The [EyeToy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy) was a camera that you put on
your TV so your body could be the controller. In our game you moved your arms
and body around to pilot a hoverboard through futuristic scenes. It was a fun
game and gave you a good workout:

Harmonix's next game was [Guitar
Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero). This time I was chosen to be
the Lead Programmer which means in addition to programming I coordinated closely
with the Project Leader and the leads from each of the other disciplines: Music,
Art, Design and QA. I often had to estimate how hard it would be to program a
new feature, or suggest alternative ideas that were easier for us to
implement.

I was also responsible making sure the game was playable every day. If the daily
build failed for any reason I had to track it down.

After almost a decade of making music-based videogames that were critically well
received but had modest sales, Guitar Hero was a huge breakout hit. We knew it
was a solid and fun game, but we had no idea the economic and cultural impact it
would have. The Guitar Hero franchise went on to over two billion dollars in
sales.

The software engineering rigors of console game development are legendary.
Back then you had very limited hardware, the PlayStation 2 had only [32MB
of
RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_technical_specifications),
but the games needed to be polished and perform flawlessly. There were no
online updates back then, the bits on the gold master CD were final for all
time which meant at lot of pressure to get right.

I learned a fair amount beyond programing including user interaction
design, game design, how on-time projects with firm deadlines are managed,
and even a bit about art and music. Harmonix's games were written mostly in
C++ although around 1/3 of the code was a custom LISP-like scripting
language. We used Python for build tool and I wrote some custom continuous
integration tools that flagged which changes might have broken the build.

The musicians and artists on the team outnumbered the programmers, which
made for a fun work environment. It was eye opening to work with so many
people who had no software or engineering background but were super smart,
creative and fun to work with.

Between 2017 and 2020 I worked on several generations of cloud-based data
pipelines at [CARMERA](https://carmera.com), a company that makes maps for
self-driving cars. The pipelines were used for processing geospatial data and
for training machine learning systems. Most of the pipeline code was written in
Python, while some of the data processing itself was written in C++.

My experience with traditional single-computer software engineering applied
to the world of distributed systems more than I had anticipated. The cloud,
in some sense, is just a single large computer. The dozens of cloud
services are like the Operating System API's that desktop applications used
to use. The abstraction level is much higher, since one API call might hide
the work of thousands of of machines, but the same principles of good
design and engineering still apply.

I'm very interested in doing more cloud-based development. I believe
strongly that the cloud is a fundamentally new technology with endless
potential. However much or little you are using the cloud today, I'd be
happy to discuss how I can help.

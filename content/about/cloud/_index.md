Between 2017 and 2020 I worked on several generations of cloud-based data
pipelines at [CARMERA](https://carmera.com), a company that makes maps for
self-driving cars. The pipelines were used for processing geospatial data and
for training machine learning systems. Most of the pipeline code was written in
Python, while some of the data processing itself was written in C++.

My extensive experience with traditional single-computer software engineering
applied to the world of distributed systems more than I had anticipated. The
cloud, in some sense, is just a single large computer. The dozens of "cloud
services" are like the API's of the older desktop operating systems. This
realization is key to creating "cloud native" designs that fully exploit what
clouds have to offer.

I'm very interested in doing more cloud-based development. I believe strongly
that the cloud is not just "someone else's computer". If used properly it's a
fundamentally new technology with endless potential. However much or little you
are using the cloud today, I'd be happy to discuss how I can help.

Between 2017 and 2020 I worked at [CARMERA](https://carmera.com) on cloud-based
data pipelines. CARMERA makes maps for self-driving cars. The data pipelines I
worked on were for processing geospatial data collected by survey vehicles and
for training Machine Learning systems. Most of the pipeline code was written in
Python, while some of the data processing itself was written in C++.

My extensive experience with traditional single-computer software engineering
applied to the world of distributed systems more than I had anticipated. The
cloud in some sense is just a single large computer. The dozens of "cloud
services" are really just like the API's of desktop operating systems. This
realization is key to creating "cloud native" designs that fully exploit what
clouds have to offer.

I'm very interested in doing more cloud-based development. I believe strongly
the cloud is not just "someone else's computer", if used properly it's a
fundamentally new technology with endless potential. However much or little you
are using the cloud today, I'd be happy to discuss how I can help.

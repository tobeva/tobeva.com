Over the past 25 years I've worked in many different technical industries
such as CAD and Haptics, Autonomous Vehicles, Cloud Data Pipelines,
Neuroscience Research, Military Simulations and Videogames. Many of the
systems I have worked on have involved graphics, but not all of them.

I have found over the years that working in graphics, games and simulations
really hones your general software engineering skills.

Rendering in real-time makes you mindful of the importance of performance
and optimization, as well as teaching you how to evolve complex codebases
over time. It also makes you empathetic towards the user's experience.

When working I try to blend hard-core engineering with pragmatism. In my
opinion the goal of a software developer is to solve problems and create
value. This can involve writing code, but often selecting where to dig is
more important than the digging itself. One of the biggest sources of
preventable waste in our industry is the time and money spent writing
software that simply should never have been written.

If we work together I can travel for meetings and planning discussions, but
I will do the bulk of the work remotely. I've worked from my home in
Winchester, Virginia for over a decade, but I love to discussing things on
chat or video, so I'll be very available and visible on your project, if
that is desired.

My primary languages have been C++, Python and Javascript, but I've started
learning Go and Rust, and I'm open to other languages as well. I'm happy to
consult and simply offer advice on architecture, design, optimization or
anything related to software engineering. I can also solve hard bugs or
evaluate technology choices, or do full implementations alone or with a
team.

Please drop me a line at **philip<img src="" width="0"

and we can discuss your projects and how I might be able to help.

[LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.com/in/pwinston) &middot; [PDF Resume](/philip_winston_resume.pdf)

Over the past 25 years I've worked in many different technical industries
such as [CAD and Haptics](/about/experience/cad), [Autonomous
Vehicles](https://carmera.com), [Cloud Data
Pipelines](/about/experience/cloud/), [Neuroscience
Research](/about/experience/neuroscience/), [Military
Simulations](/about/experience/simulations/) and
[Videogames](/about/experience/videogames/). Many of the systems I have
worked on have involved graphics, but not all of them.

I have found over the years that working in graphics, games and simulations
is a fantastic way to build general software engineering skills.

When working, I try to blend hard-core engineering with pragmatism. In my
opinion the goal of a software developer is to solve problems and create
value. This can involve writing code, but often selecting where to dig is
more important than the digging itself. One of the biggest sources of
preventable waste in our industry is the time and money spent writing
software that simply should never have been written.

I work remotely from my home in Winchester, Virginia, but I love to
discuss things on chat or video, so I'll be very available and visible
on your project, if that is desired.

My primary languages have been C++, C#, Python and Javascript, but I've
started learning Go and Rust, and I'm open to other languages as well. I'm
happy to consult and simply offer advice on architecture, design,
optimization or anything related to software engineering. I can also solve
hard bugs or evaluate technology choices, or do full implementations alone
or with a team.

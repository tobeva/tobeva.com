[LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.com/in/pwinston) &middot; [PDF Resume](/philip_winston_resume.pdf)



I have been writing software professionally for more than 25 years. I've worked
in many different technical industries such as CAD and Haptics, Cloud Data
Pipelines, Neuroscience Research, Military Simulations and Videogames.

My philosophy is to blend hard-core engineering with extreme pragmatism. In my
opinion the goal of a software developer is to solve problems and create value.
This can involve writing code, but often selecting where to dig is more
important than the digging itself. One of the biggest sources of preventable
waste in our industry is the time and money spent writing software that simply
should never have been written.

I'm happy to travel for meetings and planning discussions, but I will do
the bulk of the work remotely. I've worked remotely from my home in
Winchester, Virginia for over a decade for several different companies. I
have a wonderful and productive home office. I love to write and discuss
things on chat or video, so I'll be very available and visible on your
project, if that is desired.

To date my primary languages have been C++, Python and Javascript, but I've
started learning Go and Rust, and I'm open to other languages as well. I'm happy
to consult and simply offer advice, or participate in the design and
implementation myself.

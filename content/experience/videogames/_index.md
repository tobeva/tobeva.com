The first game I worked on at [Harmonix](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/)
was [EyeToy: Antigrav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy:_AntiGrav) for
the PlayStation 2. The [EyeToy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy) was a
camera that you put on your TV so your body could be the controller. In our
game you moved your arms and body around to pilot a hoverboard through
futuristic scenes. It was a fun game and gave you a good workout.

EyeToy: AntiGrav was released in November 2004.

Harmonix's next game was [Guitar
Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero). This time I was chosen to be
the Lead Programmer which means in addition to programming I coordinated closely
with the Project Leader and the leads from each of the other disciplines: Music,
Art, Design and QA. I often had to estimate how hard it would be to program a
new feature, or suggest alternative ideas that were easier for us to
implement.

I was also responsible making sure the game was playable every day. If the
daily build failed for any reason I had to track it down. This was sometimes
fun and sometimes nerve-wracking.

The original Guitar Hero was released in November, 2005.

Guitar Hero was a huge breakout hit for Harmonix. We knew it was a solid
fun game, but we had no idea the economic and cultural impact it would
have. My favorite story about realizing the game would be big was a support
email that described someone who crashed through a glass coffee table while
playing the game.

The email concluded "after I finished the song, I went to the emergency
room". Someone inside the company sent that around and highlighted the part
that said *after I finished the song*. The Guitar Hero franchise went on to
over two billion dollars in sales.

The Sony PlayStation 2 console came out in October, 2000.

The software engineering rigors of console game development are legendary.
The PlayStation 2 had only [32MB of
RAM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_2_technical_specifications),
but the games needed to be polished and perform flawlessly. There were no
online updates back then, the bits on the gold master CD were final for all
time!

I learned a fair amount beyond programing including user interaction
design, game design, how on-time projects with firm deadlines are managed,
and even a bit about art and music. Harmonix's games were written mostly in
C++ although around 1/3 of the code was a custom LISP-like scripting
language. We used Python for build tools and I wrote some custom continuous
integration tools that flagged who had submitted changes that might have
broken the build.

The game came with a pretty nice quality guitar controller.

The musicians and artists on the team outnumbered the programmers, which
made for a fun work environment. It was eye opening to work with so many
people who had no software or engineering background but were super smart,
creative and fun to work with.

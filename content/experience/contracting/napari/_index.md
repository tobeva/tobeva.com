I contracted with [The Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) for eight months in 2020. See this
[blog post](/blog/2021/01/23/napari-2020-rendering-update/) for a
twenty-five minute overview video of the work I did for them.

The work focused on improving the rendering behavior and performance of
[Napari](https://napari.org/). Napari is an open source multi-dimensional
image viewer for Python, used for scientific imaging mostly in the fields
of Neuroscience and Biology.

Also, read my blog post about my experience [working on open source
software](/blog/2020/08/02/open-source/), and see the below links for more details about the contributions I made to the project.

**Founder**

![Headshot](headshot.jpg)

I've been writing software professionally for more than 25 years. I've worked in
many different technical industries such as CAD, Haptics, Video Games, Military
Simulations, Neuroscience Research and for the last three years I was helping to
create maps for self-driving cars. See my [projects page](/about/projects) for
pictures of the projects I've worked on.

Once the COVID restrictions are over I'm happy to travel for meetings and
planning discussions, but I will do the bulk of the work remotely. I've worked
remotely from my home for over a decade for several different companies. I love
to discuss things on chat or video, so I'll be very available and visible on
your project.

I'm interested to hear what projects you are undertaking during the remainder of
2020 and how I might be able to help.

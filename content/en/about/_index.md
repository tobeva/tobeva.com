[LinkedIn Profile](http://linkedin.com/in/pwinston) &middot; [PDF Resume](/philip_winston_resume.pdf)

I've been writing software professionally for more than 25 years. I've worked in
many different technical industries such as CAD, Haptics, Cloud Data Pipelines,
Neuroscience Research, Military Simulations and Video Games. See the individual
pages to the left (or below) for images of projects from each industry.

My philosophy is to blend hand-core engineering with pragmatism. In my opinion
the goal of a software developer is to solve problems and create value. This can
involve writing code, but often selecting where to dig is more important than
how fast you did. One of the biggest sources of preventable waste in our
industry is spending time and money to writing software that simply should never
have been written.

I'm happy to travel for meetings and planning discussions, once COVID travel
restrictions are lifted, but I will do the bulk of the work remotely. I've
worked remotely from my home for over a decade for several different companies,
I have a wonderful and productive home-office setup. I love to write and discuss
things on chat or video, so I'll be very available and visible on your project,
if that's helpful.

My primary languages have been C++, Python and Javascript, but I've started
learning Go and Rust, and I'm open to other languages as well. I'm happy to
consult and simply offer advice, even if only for a day or two, or participate
in the design and implementation myself.

Between 2017 and 2020 I worked at [CARMERA](https://carmera.com) on cloud-based
data pipelines. The data pipelines I worked on at CARMERA were for processing
geospatial data collected by survey vehicles, lidar and panoramic imagery, as
well as for training Machine Learning systems.

I quickly realized my experience with traditional single-computer software
engineering applied more fully to cloud-based development than I had
anticipated. The cloud in some sense is just a single large computer. The dozens
of "cloud services" are really just like the API's of desktop operating systems.
This realization is key to creating "cloud native" designs the fully exploit the
provided software and hardware.

I'm very interested in doing more cloud-based development. I believe strongly
the cloud is not just "someone else's computer", if used properly it's a
fundamentally new technology with endless potential. However much or little
you are using the cloud today, I'd be happy to discuss how I can help.

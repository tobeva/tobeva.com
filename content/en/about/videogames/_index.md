I joined [Harmonix](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/) in 2003 to work on [EyeToy:
Antigrav](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy:_AntiGrav) for the PlayStation 2.
The [EyeToy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EyeToy) was a camera that you put on
your TV so your body could be the controller. In our game you moved your arms
and body around to pilot a hoverboard through futuristic scenes. It was a fun
game and gave you a good workout:

Harmonix's next game was [Guitar
Hero](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guitar_Hero). This time I was chosen to be
the Lead Programmer which means in addition to programming I coordinated closely
with the Project Leader and the leads from each of the other disciplines: Music,
Art, Design and QA. I often had to estimate how hard it would be to to program a
new feature, or suggest an alternative idea that were easier for us to
implement.

I was also responsible making sure the game was playable every day, if the daily
build failed or any reason I had to track it down.

After almost a decade of making music-based videogames that were critically well
received but had modest sales, Guitar Hero was a huge breakout hit. We knew it
was a solid and fun game, but we had no idea the economic and cultural impact it
would have. The Guitar Hero franchise went on to over two billion dollars in
sales.

I learned a lot of great software engineering habits while at Harmonix.  The
rigors of console game development are legendary, since you have limited
hardware but the games need to be polished and perform flawlessly.

The games were written mostly in C++ but we also used a custom scripting
language and we used Python for build tools. The musician and artists on the
team outnumbered the programmers, which made for a fun work environment. I
learned a fair amount beyond programing including interaction design and how on-time
projects are managed.

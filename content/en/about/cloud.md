For the last three years I've been focused on cloud-based data pipelines. While
I still enjoy graphics, I'm very interested in continuing with cloud-based
development. The cloud has or will touch every corner of the software industry
and it's a fascinating stack of technologies.

One of my big takeaways from the cloud work is that the lessons learned from
decades of traditional single-computer software engineering fully apply to the
cloud world. The cloud is best thought of as a single large computer, where the
many cloud services are like the operating system API's of old, so my lengthy
experience with traditional software engineering translates over very well
to the cloud world.

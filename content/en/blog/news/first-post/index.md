As I'm writing this the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases worldwide is above
1,600,000 while the number deaths is nearing 100,000. It's believed that in the
United States we are approaching the "peak", perhaps within the next few days.

It's extremely difficult to guess how the next few months will play out. How
long until people can leave their homes freely, return to work, walk in public
without masks. Until there is a vaccine the threat of a flare up will be ever
present, in the United States and around the world.

The economic recovery is arguably even harder to predict. The economic impact of
COVID-19 has been compared to a major hurricane hitting every single one of the
fifty states all at the same time, although I suspect in some ways this might
even be understating things.

However there is an important difference between the havoc wreaked by COVID-19
and past disasters that we've endured. Unlike war, terrorism, fires, floods,
earthquakes and hurricanes, this time the physical infrastructure of the country
is essentially untouched. There's no wreckage to remove, no husks of cars or
twisted metal, no buildings to raze or erect, no power lines or communication
infrastructure to repair.

This strangeness is starkly evident when I look out my window and see a
beautiful spring day. It looks like not a blade of grass is out of place.
Everything looks fine until I turn on the news or remember I abruptly lost my
job a few days ago after three years with a tech startup. We were working on
maps for self-driving cars, an idea which seems like a distant fantasy at the
moment.

So what do we do now? First we should tally up our collective resources.

The state of our technological infrastructure, as flawed as it is, is the best
it's been during the 4.5 billion years this planet has existed. There are
hundreds of millions of smart resourceful hardworking people in the world. These
capable people are connected by an estimated 700,000 miles of fiber optic cable
and trillions of lines of computer code. We, as a species, are in the process of
launching tens of thousands of communication satellites into space which will
provide internet connections where those cables don't reach.

So what can I do, one lone little person? I'm starting a software company, just
myself for now, that I'm calling Tobeva Software. The name is a combination our
children's names, Toby and Eva, since they were young we'd say things "did
Tobeva have fun at the park?"

I want to use this company as a platform to share things I've learned, and to
hoover up new information as effectively as I can so that I can share more
things in the future. I want to be equipped and prepared so that I can work with
others to solve problems, whether by giving advice or writing useful software.

When my children, our children, face the next big would-be pandemic I'm hoping
we can shift into offline work and school in a matter of hours, I'm hoping we
can synthesize a vaccine in a matter of days, and I'm hoping we can kick that
virus in the teeth before it kills a single person. It will take years, perhaps
decades, of hard work combined with a new breed of global cooperation to get
there.

Starting... now.

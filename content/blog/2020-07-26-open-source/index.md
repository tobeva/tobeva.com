I started Tobeva Software in April of this year and one of the first
opportunities to come my way was a contract working for [The Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) on an open source
project called [Napari](https://napari.org/tutorials/gallery).

Napari is a multi-dimensional image viewer written in Python for the
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) community. Napari is used by
Neuroscientists and Biologists to view and analyze complex image data.
SciPy is a thriving ecosystem of Python software used for mathematics,
science and engineering. SciPy is healthy part of the surge in popularity
of Python over the last few years.

In my career I've mostly worked for commercial companies developing
proprietary software. It's been a lot of fun to learn the ropes of open
source, it's refreshing to be developing in the open and seeing how open
source projects are run and how their contributors coordinate and
collaborate with each other.

One thing that's great about open source is you can send [GitHub
links](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/1453) to friends and
colleagues to show off your work or ask for input. This is the polar
opposite of the proprietary world where essentially everything is "secret"
even the mundane stuff that does not at all merit being secret.

Another nice thing about open source is knowing you'll have permanent
access to the code that you are writing. If you leave a company you
generally leave behind everything that you wrote for them. With open source
if the licenses are compatible you can grab your old code and throw it into
a new project.

Finally this might not always be the case, but with Napari the contributors
are mostly power users of the software who are highly invested in its
success There is no real boundary between the developers and the users,
it's more of this nice continuum. There's far more of a community than in
some commercial efforts where you are more or less throwing the code over a
wall to users you may never interact with.

Related to this it's amazing how people from different projects interact.
Developers for packages we depend might lurk on our chats and chime in
with helpful advice. Meanwhile many Napari developers contribute to
upstream and downstream dependencies. Even when I file issues on projects
unrelated to ours I've generally found super helpful replies from their
core developers within hours.

Not everything is fun and easy with open source. It can be a challenge to
get everyone on the same page when they are all coming from different
organizations. People's time commitments to the project vary widely, some
people are monitoring the project but not really following everything very
closely, and they might seem to be out of sync at times. However even those
only partly paying attention to the project are still welcome, having some
attention is much better than having none.

After so many years of commercial development I find the open source model
to be exciting and productive. I think commercial software still has a
place, but there are some strong benefits to open source. I'm eager to work
on more open source projects in the future and I'm hopeful that Tobeva Software
will soon host some open source software of its own.

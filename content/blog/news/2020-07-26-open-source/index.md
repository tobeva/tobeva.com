I'm several months in to Tobeva Software's first contract which is with
[The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) for an open
source project called [Napari](https://napari.org/tutorials/gallery), a
multi-dimensional image viewer. Napari is used by scientists including
Neuroscientists and Biologists to view and analyze complex image data. It's
written in Python and is part of the thriving
[SciPy](https://www.scipy.org/) ecosystem of Python software used for
mathematics, science and engineering.

Most of the software development I've done has for commercial companies
developing proprietary software. It's been a lot of fun to learn the ropes
of developing "in the open" and see how projects are run and how the
contributors coordinate with developers on other projects.

Some things I really like about working on open source so far:

* You can send links to your work to anyone in the world and they see your
  code, documents, discussions. This is such a huge change from commercial
  development where almost everything you do is "secret by default".

* You know you'll have permanent access to the code you are writing. At
  most commercial companies you cannot use or even look at the code you
  wrote while there. Which could be years of effort. With open source you
  not only have permanent access to the code, you can re-use it in another
  project if it's also open source with a compatible license.

* Most contributors are also users. There is no sense you are "throwing the
  code over the wall" for the users to use it. Many contributors are
  participating in the development precisely because the software is
  important to them, which makes them passionate.

* You have nice interactions with the developers of "neighboring" projects.
  The creators of projects you depend on or which depend on you tend to be
  super helpful in trying resolve issues or give advice. Everyone wants the
  whole ecosystem to flourish not just their own project.

* It feels like the project could be around a long time. If a company drops
  a proprietary project it can just disappear, but an open source project
  can outlive any one sponsor.

There are also some challenges specific to open source. One is that
people's time commitment varies widely from full-time to "just checking in
once in a while". At a company pretty much everyone is working full-time.
With open source I've found reviews and feedback sometimes trickle in
slowly over time as people check in with the project.

Still I find the open source model to be exciting and productive.  As a
consultant and contractor I'm really excited about being able to point
people my contributions. Surprisingly in the commercial world it's
considered totally normal to have have worked somewhere for years and yet
have essentially nothing to show for it except your own story about what
you did there.

### SE Radio

I just finished my first year as a volunteer host for [Software Engineering
Radio](https://www.se-radio.net/). Over the last year I recorded [five
episodes](https://www.se-radio.net/team/philip-winston/) and they have now
all aired and are available on their webiste or through any podcasting app.

This post is about how I got involved with the show and what it's like to
be a host. In March 2020, right when COVID was starting to take off, I
wrote [Robert Blumen](https://www.se-radio.net/team/robert-blumen/). He's
the show editor for Software Engineering Radio and I told him I was
interested in becoming a volunteer host for the podcast.

# Planet Couch

I heard back promptly, but I was put on the waiting list. In the meantime,
while we were all stuck at home during the first months of COVID, I
recorded a silly YouTube show with my teenage son called
[Planet Couch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQXKwBBtxdqcYBw5VTD4Wng).

This was an outlet and bonding experience for my son and me during
stressful times. It also gave me glimpse of what it was like to carry on a
conversation while staying aware there will later be an audience. It gives
you a buzz similar to being on stage, and yet it's totally different since
there is no audience at the time.

In May of 2021 Robert emailed me to say there was an opening for a host on
the show and I started the onboarding process. Robert is very organized and
runs the show at a professional level, even though the hosts are
volunteers.

# Hosting

Hosting is like having a second job, but a mini-job. You only need to
record about one show every two months. Combined the nine hosts produce a
new show almost every week.

I found that recording the epsiode is actually the easiest part, which
suprised me. By then you're hopefully well prepared and you are usually
interviewing a true expert, so it's pretty easy to keep them talking for
about an hour.

The hardest part for me and many of the hosts is eliminate "filler words".
I was able to excise "um" from my vocabulary pretty easily, but words like
"okay" and "so" and “I guess” keep croping up. This a good skill to master
for real-life as well, at least in somewhat formal settings.

Most of the effort towards preparing a show involves vetting and lining up
the guests, but the activity that feels most like homework is producing an
outline for the show. It's easy to drag your feet on doing the research you
need to do in order to write a good outline. An outline is not a list of
questions, necessarily, but it should lead to about an hour's worth of
questions and discussion.

Our shows generally follow a structure that includes a lot of background
and educational material, more so than podcasts which sometimes dive right
into what the guest is promoting. Before writing the outline I will read a
lot online, and often watch YouTube episodes or listen to episodes from our
podcast or other podcasts.

# Finding Guests

As host a you can come up with topics and find your own guests, but people
are constantly pitching ideas to the show as well. Interestingly a lot are
submitted by PR representatives. If approved by Robert these topics and
guests are available first-come first-serve basis to any host.

For my first five shows only one was my idea and my guest, although I
attempted to arrange other shows that didn't end up happening. I have some
ideas for future shows, but doing "incoming pitches" worked out better than
I thought they would. Even though I didn't come up with them, there were
many topics to choose from I was able to pick things I was interested in.

If you have an idea for a show topic or a guest, feel free to [email
me](/about) or see the show's [content
guidelines](https://www.se-radio.net/about/content-guidelines/) for
instructions on how to pitch the show.

# Wrapping up (a podcasting phrase!)

I'd recommend becoming a Software Engineering Radio host if it sounds
intriguing to you. Or you could host your own podcast or a YouTube channel.
I think producing content builds skills that can benefit you in your main
job,  and it can be really fun and rewarding.

I enjoy talking to experts and being able to ask them whatever I want. The
guests tend to be pretty cool people and hosting is good motivation to
learn new things and stay up-to-date in our rapidly changing field.

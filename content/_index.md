### Overview

I started **Tobeva Software** in April 2020 to do consulting and contracting in
cloud data pipelines, high-performance systems and computer graphics.

I had two contract positions during COVID. The first was with <a
href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/">Chan Zuckerberg</a> working on <a
href="https://napari.org/">napari</a>, a multi-dimensional image viewer for
Python. The second a music-game called <a
href="https://tonestone.com/">ToneStone</a>, by the former project lead of
Guitar Hero.

More recently I returned to working full-time jobs. I'm currently doing backend
and pipeline work full-time for a company called <a
href="https://www.researchsquare.com/">Research Square</a>. I work remotely from
my home in Winchester, Virginia. Tobeva Software is on the back burner, but it
still exists. Please drop me a line at **philip<img src="" width="0"

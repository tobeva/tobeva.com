In February, 2021 I started doing some contracting work for
[ToneStone](https://tonestone.com).

From their website, "ToneStone is a place where anyone can make music. The
ToneStone platform removes all barriers to song making, providing the
tools, content and community for unlocking musical creativity. Co-founded
by former leaders from Harmonix, Valve, and Amazon, ToneStone is currently
in development and in private testing."

Watch this [nicely produced interview](https://youtu.be/iP7dIvxr0ls) with
Greg LoPicollo, the CEO of ToneStone, for some background on Greg's career
and a hint at what ToneStone is working on. I worked with Greg back in 2005
when we were both at [Harmonix](https://www.harmonixmusic.com/) where we
made [Guitar Hero](/about/experience/videogames/).

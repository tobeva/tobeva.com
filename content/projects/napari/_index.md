We are working on an ongoing paid contract for [The Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) to improve the rendering behavior
and performance of [Napari](https://napari.org/).

Napari is an open source multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, used
for scientific imaging mostly in the fields of Neuroscience and Biology.

Read my blog post about my experience [working on open source
software](/blog/2020/08/02/open-source/), and see the below links to the
specific contributions I've made to the Napari project so far, including a
nice demo video.

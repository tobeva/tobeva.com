**Latest Update**: See [our blog
post](/blog/2021/01/23/napari-2020-rendering-update/) for a twenty-five
minute overview video of all napari projects we did in 2020.

For eight months in 2020 we worked on a paid contract for [The Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) to improve the
rendering behavior and performance of [Napari](https://napari.org/). Napari
is an open source multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, used for
scientific imaging mostly in the fields of Neuroscience and Biology.

software](/blog/2020/08/02/open-source/), and see the below links to the
specific contributions I've made to the Napari project.

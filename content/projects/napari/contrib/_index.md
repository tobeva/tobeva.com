**GitHub Project**
* [Napari Rendering GitHub Project](https://github.com/users/pwinston/projects/1)
  * Lists over 50 pull requests we made in the napari repo.
  * GitHub's [projects](https://github.com/features/project-management/) are an underused way to organize your PRs.
      * It's like JIRA minus all the junk you don't need.
      * But then super tightly integrated into GitHub.

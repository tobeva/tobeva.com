### Comments

In programming we call the `#` character "hash". In Python anything that
comes after the `#` character is a *comment*.

For example:

{{< highlight python >}}
# Let's print something
print("Hello World!")  # nice job!
# We are done
{{< / highlight >}}

will just print:

```
Hello World
```

Comments are for the **human** reading the program. However be kind to the human
because that human could be you! When you write a lot of programs, you need to
leave comments in order to understand the code later on.

The code tells the computer what to do, the comments tell the human why the code
was written that way.

### Assignment

1. Write a program that has three print statements and three comments.
1. You can print anything you want.
2. Your comments can say anything you want.

Make sure you run your program to test it.

## Hello World
It's a tradition that the first program you write when learning a new programming language is one that just prints the words "Hello World!" to the screen.

We do this just because it's pretty much simplest program we can write, and because it makes sure everything is working. If you can write and run this small program, you can write and run any program!

## Your First Function: print()

When your program needs to do something it can *call a function*.

When you call the `print` function it will print text to the screen.

For example:

{{< highlight python >}}
print("I love programming.")
{{< / highlight >}}

that will print this to the screen:

```
I love programming.
```

## The Assignment

1. Write your program in the pane below.
1. Run your program by clicking the **Run** button below the pane.

## Your Program

{{< ide >}}# Write your program here.
{{< /ide >}}

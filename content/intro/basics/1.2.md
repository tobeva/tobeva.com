## Variables

Variables are *names* for *values*.

For example let's create a variable with the name `x`:

{{< highlight python >}}
x = 3
print(x)
{{< / highlight >}}

That will print:

```
3
```

We assigned the value 3 to the name x.

So when we print x, it prints 3.

Because x has the value 3.

Easy!

## Variable Names

Variable names can be short or long. They can be a single letter, a single word,
or several words separate by underscores.

These are all possible names for variables:

```
x
y
fred
my_favorite_animal
the_temperature_today
```

## Assignment

1. Come up with three variable names.
2. Assign them three different values.
3. Print each of the variables.

### Welcome to Programming!

Writing a program is like solving a puzzle. The great thing about solving a
puzzle is that you become better at solving puzzles. You build mental muscles.
Programming can help you think more clearly and it can teach you how to
patiently do complex things.

The muscles you build while programming can even help you solve puzzles that
have nothing to do with computers!

We are going to learn how to program using the **Python** programming language.

However this is a course about programming, not about Python. We need to learn
some Python as we go, but we will skip over a lot of details. There are many
courses you can take after this one to learn more Python or learn other
programming languages.

Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It is used
by millions of programmers every day. Python is used to build software and
websites that you probably use and enjoy. Python is a great introductory
language because it's not *super* complicated, but it can be used to write
almost any program.

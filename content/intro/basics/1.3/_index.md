## Variables can vary

What will this print?

{{< highlight python >}}
x = 3
print(x)

x = 4
print(x)
{{< / highlight >}}

It will print:

```
3
4
```

The first time we *assign* the value 3 to the variable `x`.

The second time we *assign* the value 4 to the variable `x`.

Variables can vary: the *value* of a variable can change!

## Names and Values

This of variables as a name pointing to a value.

At first x had the value 3 like this:

![x=3](x3.png)

Then we assigned it the value 4 like this:

![x=4](x4.png)

So our same `x` variable held two different values.

## Assignment

1. Create a variable and assign it three different values.
2. After each assignment print the variable's value.

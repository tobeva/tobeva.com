## Make Your Own Functions

In Python you can make your own functions. You can give your function any name
that you want, and you can decide what your function should do. Then you can
call your function, as many times as you want.

## Define A Function

In Python we define a function with the `def` keyword, where `def` is short for
the word "define". Here's an example function that prints **hello**:

{{< highlight python >}}
def greet():
  print("hello")
{{< / highlight >}}

Notice the print line is indented. In Python indentation is very important. You
can indent using the tab key on your keyboard. Sometimes the editor will indent
for you.

## Call A Function

We call our function like this:

{{< highlight python >}}
greet()
{{< / highlight >}}

Run the program it should print:

```
hello
```

So the `print()` function can print anything, but our `greet()` function always
prints the word **hello**. We created the function `greet()` and we decided what
it should do.

### Assignment

1. Come up with 3 or more functions similar to greet.
2. Make 5-10 calls to your functions, so it prints a sentence. 

## Your Program

{{< ide >}}# Write your program here.
{{< /ide >}}

## Make Your Own Functions

In Python you can make your own functions. You give your function a name, any
name you want, and you decide what your function should do. Then you can call
your function, as many times as you want.

## Define A Function

In Python we define a function with the `def` keyword, where `def` is short for
the word "define". Here's an example function that prints **hello**:

```
def greet():
  print("hello")
```

Notice the print line is indented. In Python indentation is very important. You
can indent using the tab key on your keyboard. Sometimes the editor will indent
for you.

## Call A Function

We call our function like this:

```
greet()
```

Run the program, click on console to see the output.

It should print:

```
hello
```

### Assignment

1. Come up with 3 or more functions similar to greet.
2. Make 5-10 calls to your functions, so it prints a sentence.

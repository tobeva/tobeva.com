### Functions

## Functions

What are functions? In Python a function is something you can "call". When you
call the function it does something. We already used the `print` function. When
you call the print function, it prints to the screen!

## Three Types Of Functions

#### Built-in Functions

Python has many built-in functions. Some built-in functions besides `print()`
include `filter()`, `format()`, `pow()`, `range()`. There are over 100 built-in
functions! We will learn more as we go.

#### Module Functions

If you need to do something that no built-in function can do, Python comes with
many **modules** that also contain functions. Python contains over 100 modules
and each one contains dozens of functions.

If that wasn't enough, on the internet there are thousands of modules you can
download. There are millions of functions out there you can use! Very often if
you want a function in Python, someone has already written it and you can just
call it.

One module we will learn soon is called `turtle`, it contains many functions
related to drawing on the screen.

#### Your Own Functions

Most importantly Python lets you write *your own functions*. Your own functions
can call built-in functions, module functions, and the key fact about
programming is your own can call your own functions!

#### We Will Start Slow

We are going to start at the very basics and learn all about functions.

Much of programming is writing functions and calling functions.

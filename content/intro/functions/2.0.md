## Introducing Turtle

We are now going to start using the Python module called `turtle`. The `turtle`
module lets us draw lines on the screen. Run the program below. It should draw a
square!

## Why is it called Turtle? 

Imagine there is a turtle walking along the ground, and you can tell him what to
do. That's how the turtle module works. You are telling the turtle what to do.

In our program below we tell him to walk forward 100 pixels, then turn left 90
degrees. Then walk again, then turn again. He walks 4 times one for each of the
sides, and he turns 3 times. That makes a square.

## Colors

Before he starts walking/drawing you can set the color like this:

```
turtle.color("red")
```

Some colors available are:

```
white
black
red
green
blue
cyan
yellow
magenta
```

### Assignment

1. Make it so each side of the square is drawn in a different color.
2. Run your program to make sure it looks right.
3. Submit your program.

## Your Program

{{< ide >}}import turtle

turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
turtle.left(90)
turtle.forward(100)
{{< /ide >}}

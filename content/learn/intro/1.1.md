## Hello World
It's a tradition that the first program you write when learning a new programming language is one that just prints the words "Hello World!" to the screen.

We do this just because it's pretty much simplest program we can write, and because it makes sure everything is working. If you can write and run this small program, you can write and run any program!

## The print() function

When your program needs to do something it can *call a function*.

When you call the `print` function it will print text to the screen.

For example:

```
print("I love programming.")
```

it will print this to the screen:

```
I love programming.
```

## Comments

The `#` character in programming is called the "hash" character.

In Python anything after the hash on a line is a comment.
For example:

```
# Let's print something
print("Hello World!")  # nice job!
# We are done
```

The above code has three comments.

The computer only runs the `print` statement, so the above code will just print:

```
Hello World
```

Comments are **for the human** reading the program, but realize the human might
be you! Because if you write a lot of programs, you will forget how they work
or why you wrote it a certain way. Comments can help the person reading
the program understand it.

## Assignment

1. Write a program that has three print statements and three comments.
1. You can print anything you want.
1. Your comments can say anything you want.

Make sure you run your program to test it.
When done submit it.

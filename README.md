# Tobeva.com

Tobeva Software maintains the website [tobeva.com](https://tobeva.com).

This repo generates that site. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme.

Although this is "our" website, we make the source public because most of the contents is visible publically on the site anyway, so there is really noting to hide. Also we will accept PR's particularly into the [resources](content/resources) section if you have corrections or additions.

See the `Makefile` commands `make serve`, `make build` and `make deploy`. Although if you have a small change to a text file you can probably just submit the PR and we can test it.

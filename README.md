Tobeva Software maintains the website [tobeva.com](https://tobeva.com).

This repo generates that site. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme.

Although this is "our" website, but we make the source public because most of the contents is visible publically anyway no the site. We will accept PR's particularly into the [resources](content/resources) section if you have corrections or additions.

See the `Makefile` commands `make serve`, `make build` and `make deploy`.

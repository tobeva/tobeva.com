# Tobeva.com

Tobeva Software maintains the website [tobeva.com](https://tobeva.com).

This repo generates that site. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme. We're making the source public because most of the content is public anyway, and maybe it will benefit someone.

**Also, we will accept PR's**, particularly into the [resources](content/resources) section if you want to suggest new resources or make corrections.

See the `Makefile` commands `make serve`, `make build` and `make deploy`. Although if you have a small change to a text file you can probably just create the PR without testing, and we can test it.

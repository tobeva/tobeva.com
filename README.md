# Tobeva.com

Tobeva Software maintains the website [tobeva.com](https://tobeva.com).

This repo generates that site. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme.

**We apperciate PR's**, particularly into the [resources](content/resources) section, which is very thin right now.

See the `Makefile` commands `make serve`, `make build` and `make deploy`. Although if you are just changing a markdown file, feel free to submit the PR without testing, we will test it.

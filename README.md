# Tobeva.com

Tobeva Software maintains the website tobeva.com.

This repo generates that site. It uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme.

The "wiki" section of the site is not really a wiki, it can't be edited on the site. But you can "edit the wiki" by creating a PR into this repo:

* [Wiki](content/wiki)

I don't expect anyone will, but that's the reason this repo is public. Plus there is nothing to hide since 100% of the content is visible on the site anyway:

See the `Makefile` commands `make serve`, `make build` and `make deploy`.

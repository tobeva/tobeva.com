# Tobeva.com

Tobeva Software maintains the webiste tobeva.com.

Theis repo uses [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [Docsy](https://github.com/google/docsy) theme.

The "wiki" section of the website is not really a wiki, it's just static pages. But you can "edit the wiki" by creating a PR into this repo. I don't expect anyone will, but that's the reason this repo is public. Plus there is nothing to hide since 100% of the content is visible on the site anyway.
